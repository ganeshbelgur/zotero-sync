# Zotero Sync
Over a period of time, the collection of papers one would need to refer and cite just explodes. This backup holds my Zotero citation database that I'll be using for future research work and more. Once the database is set in place, it is relatively easy to export a Bibtex file out for citation purposes. Please feel free to download the repository and take a look at the papers I'm referring to! Do recommened papers to me via Github Issues if you will.

## Porting the backup
By leveraging Zotero's standard procedure for porting data around, one need not worry about losing data.
Take a look at Zotero's documentation [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/transferring_a_library) for more information.

**TL;DR steps**
Step 1: Clone this repository to the location where Zotero expects the data to be found on your machine
Step 2: Rename the reposiroty name to 'Zotero' unless there is a different name that you have specified in your Zotero settings
